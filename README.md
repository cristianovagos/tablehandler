# TableHandler
Custom-made language for handling tables parsed from CSV files. Built with Java, ANTLR4 and also using String Template.

This language was made for the subject LFA (Linguagens Formais e Aut√≥matos) final project, where we had the opportunity to create our own programming language.
The scope was proposed by teachers, and we (me and Paulo Gil - paulogil@ua.pt) started building it around it.

More information about the language itself can be found on "relatorio.pdf" file. (Written in Portuguese)
